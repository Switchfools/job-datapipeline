You will join our small, but growing machine learning team at Cazana. This role requires someone with experience designing machine learning models production-ready to compliment our current team's knowledge and skillset. You will be given space and autonomy to experiment and deliver the best possible models to support the business needs. We have available many years of data in various forms that are still yet to be used to create new models.
About us

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Founded in 2013, we are disrupting an industry which has typically been associated with mistrust due to the lack of accurate data. We use innovative AI and data-science driven modelling in a sector that can feel dated and we have developed the industry’s first real-time retail-driven valuations. Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:
Fairer to insurers: Avoid fraud. Price every policy correctly

Fairer to policyholders: Pay the right premium. Have claims settled fairly and fast.

Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models

Fairer to lenders: Lend based on fact, not anecdotes to reduce risk.

Fairer to dealers: Stock the right vehicles. Achieve a fair price for them all.

Several open phase I - III studies, aiming to recruit approx. 2,000 patients, are currently generating further data on patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and exploratory endpoints such as minimal residual disease. The applicant will work closely in an interdisciplinary team of data managers, statisticians, biologists and physicians to address timely key questions on ML-guided diagnosis, treatment and prognostication of CLL.

Applications from female candidates are expressly welcome and will be given priority in the event of equal suitability, competence and professional performance.

People with disabilities are welcome to apply and will be treated preferentially in the event of equal suitability and qualification.

oda,2.1,Data Scientist,Oslo,"
Build, scale, and maintain data products based on machine learning, optimization, and other types of algorithms on Google Cloud Platform. We run all of this in containers on Kubernetes under the hood, but as a data scientist, you should only need to know how to write Python code to get your stuff into production! 
Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects. 
Perform complex data analysis, communicate insights tailored to different audiences, and make recommendations based on your findings that contribute to company strategic decisions. We strive to preach and practice decision intelligence in organizational decision-making, and as a member of Data & Insight, you play a key role in these efforts. 
Contribute to our data- and insights-driven culture and community by sharing your knowledge and expertise with the team and with the company. We even have our own Data University, which is Data & Insight’s knowledge base and course catalog on everything from making correct decisions based on data to building better data products. 
Have some years of experience working as a data scientist in a business or research setting. 
Feel productive with Python and SQL, and enjoy both building things and extracting insights from data. 
Know how to apply different algorithms to solve different problems — whether it is ARIMA models for forecasting or neural networks for product recommendations — and are excited to expand your comfort zone by learning new methods and diving deeper into particular subfields. 
Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you. 
Fluency in English. 
Have a Master’s degree within a technical/engineering field or quantitative field, like computer science, physics, economics, statistics, mathematics, etc. 
Possess a strong analytical mindset, combined with creativity in the face of novel problems, and curiosity and daring when venturing into unknown territory. 
The opportunity to make a lasting mark on the daily lives of the people around you, through a product that truly contributes to their general well-being. 
A large, tight-knit Data & Insight specialist community — there are over 30 of us embedded in various teams within the company at the time of writing, and we all maintain strong ties even though we work in widely different areas! 
Excellent opportunities for personal and professional development and progression in a fast-growing, ever-changing tech company with new challenges and opportunities to solve meaningful, previously unsolved problems around every corner. We make it a priority to facilitate internal promotion and mobility so you can keep growing within the company. 
Enthusiastic colleagues who truly care about supporting and helping others. 
An onboarding program where all new employees get to work hands-on in delivery, picking, replenishment, and customer service — in addition to our Data & Insight-specific onboarding. 
Get to know our way of working with OKR's — a framework we share with Google, Twitter, and Uber — and Flow, our own system for working within and between development teams to create value. 
A transparent workplace where we use Quip and Slack to communicate, discuss and share what we are working on, and stay in the loop with fewer e-mails and meetings. 
A culture that embraces and celebrates differences, built on tolerance, collaboration, and compassion. We actively seek to hire people with differences in education, personality, skillset, life experience, and knowledge base.

Build, scale, and maintain data products based on machine learning, optimization, and other types of algorithms on Google Cloud Platform. We run all of this in containers on Kubernetes under the hood, but as a data scientist, you should only need to know how to write Python code to get your stuff into production! 
Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects.

Feel productive with Python and SQL, and enjoy both building things and extracting insights from data. 
Know how to apply different algorithms to solve different problems — whether it is ARIMA models for forecasting or neural networks for product recommendations — and are excited to expand your comfort zone by learning new methods and diving deeper into particular subfields. 
Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you. 
Fluency in English. 
Have a Master’s degree within a technical/engineering field or quantitative field, like computer science, physics, economics, statistics, mathematics, etc.

Excellent opportunities for personal and professional development and progression in a fast-growing, ever-changing tech company with new challenges and opportunities to solve meaningful, previously unsolved problems around every corner. We make it a priority to facilitate internal promotion and mobility so you can keep growing within the company. 
Enthusiastic colleagues who truly care about supporting and helping others.

Build, scale, and maintain data products based on machine learning, optimization, and other types of algorithms on Google Cloud Platform. We run all of this in containers on Kubernetes under the hood, but as a data scientist, you should only need to know how to write Python code to get your stuff into production! 
Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects. 
Perform complex data analysis, communicate insights tailored to different audiences, and make recommendations based on your findings that contribute to company strategic decisions. We strive to preach and practice decision intelligence in organizational decision-making, and as a member of Data & Insight, you play a key role in these efforts. 
Contribute to our data- and insights-driven culture and community by sharing your knowledge and expertise with the team and with the company.

Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you.

Our team is fully remote and so you can work exclusively from home, although we need you to be based in the UK. We will eventually open an office hub in London for meet-ups and team events. 
We work 40 hours per week on average. We don’t work evenings or weekends, although we plan to have a paid-on-call rota. 
Our product and technology team is currently nine people, although we plan to grow later this summer. 
The Room also includes sales, marketing, customer success and finance/data teams. We are currently 30 people. 
You would report to our CTO (me) or another engineering manager when we hire them. I report to our two founders, Alex and Tanya. 
I started my career as a software engineer and have been a CTO for 13+ years, growing teams from 0-50 in startups and small and large businesses. My last job was CTO of Gumtree. This is not my first rodeo! 
You’re welcome no matter what your age, gender, sexuality, race or physical ability. We believe your experience is valuable and should have a voice. 
It’s essential that you have at least two years of recent work experience using Ruby on Rails. We’re building our backend API using Rails so you need to know the framework inside-out. 
You should be comfortable with relational databases and SQL. Our choice is PostgreSQL. 
We write tests using RSpec with a CI/CD pipeline for engineers to deploy frequently to production every day. 
We’re happy Heroku customers and enjoy its excellent CI and Review Apps that are built from GitHub PRs. 
Background jobs are performed using Sidekiq and Redis. 
We are evaluating RabbitMQ to help manage queues. 
We work in cross-functional teams using Scrum, with stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospectives. 
We'll give you a M1 MacBook Pro or high spec PC laptop if you prefer. 
You’ll communicate using Google Workspace (G Suite) and Slack. 
There is a short, initial phone call with our recruiter, Simeon. 
The next stage is a one-hour video call with our CTO (me). I’ll dig deeper into your experience, technical skills and approach. 
Finally, there is a one-hour screen-share/video call for a technical assessment with our lead engineer. We’ll send you a brief beforehand so you can prepare. We’ll ask you to work on a feature and talk about your opinions as you’re coding.

We work 40 hours per week on average. We don’t work evenings or weekends, although we plan to have a paid-on-call rota. 
Our product and technology team is currently nine people, although we plan to grow later this summer. 
The Room also includes sales, marketing, customer success and finance/data teams. We are currently 30 people.

You’re welcome no matter what your age, gender, sexuality, race or physical ability. We believe your experience is valuable and should have a voice. 
It’s essential that you have at least two years of recent work experience using Ruby on Rails. We’re building our backend API using Rails so you need to know the framework inside-out. 
You should be comfortable with relational databases and SQL. Our choice is PostgreSQL.
