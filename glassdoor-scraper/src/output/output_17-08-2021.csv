About us

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Founded in 2013, we are disrupting an industry which has typically been associated with mistrust due to the lack of accurate data. We use innovative AI and data-science driven modelling in a sector that can feel dated and we have developed the industry’s first real-time retail-driven valuations. Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:
Fairer to insurers: Avoid fraud. Price every policy correctly

Fairer to policyholders: Pay the right premium. Have claims settled fairly and fast.

Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!Show more ",https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=317&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000017b570e4750ac720e5325b86a15&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_6da45ded&cb=1629253159418&jobListingId=1007228708469&jrtk=2-0-1fdbgshrln528801-1fdbgshufu2ap800-e982d9ec04284b72,4.0,4.4,4.0,4.3,Full-time,Information Technology,data scientist,10000+ Employees,NaN

» Your future in detail

We are looking for a highly motivated data scientist to join our study group at the University Hospital of Cologne. The applicant will conduct research in the field of machine learning (ML) in haematology with particular focus on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) is one of the internationally leading research groups on CLL. Over 8,000 patients have been treated in GCLLSG clinical trials so far and a large database covering clinical data as well as multilevel omics data has been built over two decades. Several open phase I - III studies, aiming to recruit approx. 2,000 patients, are currently generating further data on patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and exploratory endpoints such as minimal residual disease. The applicant will work closely in an interdisciplinary team of data managers, statisticians, biologists and physicians to address timely key questions on ML-guided diagnosis, treatment and prognostication of CLL.

Applications from female candidates are expressly welcome and will be given priority in the event of equal suitability, competence and professional performance.

People with disabilities are welcome to apply and will be treated preferentially in the event of equal suitability and qualification.

The position is suitable for staffing with part-time employees.

Build, scale, and maintain data products based on machine learning, optimization, and other types of algorithms on Google Cloud Platform. We run all of this in containers on Kubernetes under the hood, but as a data scientist, you should only need to know how to write Python code to get your stuff into production! 
Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects. 
Perform complex data analysis, communicate insights tailored to different audiences, and make recommendations based on your findings that contribute to company strategic decisions. We strive to preach and practice decision intelligence in organizational decision-making, and as a member of Data & Insight, you play a key role in these efforts. 
Contribute to our data- and insights-driven culture and community by sharing your knowledge and expertise with the team and with the company.

Have some years of experience working as a data scientist in a business or research setting. 
Feel productive with Python and SQL, and enjoy both building things and extracting insights from data. 
Know how to apply different algorithms to solve different problems — whether it is ARIMA models for forecasting or neural networks for product recommendations — and are excited to expand your comfort zone by learning new methods and diving deeper into particular subfields. 
Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you. 
Fluency in English.

Excellent opportunities for personal and professional development and progression in a fast-growing, ever-changing tech company with new challenges and opportunities to solve meaningful, previously unsolved problems around every corner. We make it a priority to facilitate internal promotion and mobility so you can keep growing within the company. 
Enthusiastic colleagues who truly care about supporting and helping others. 
An onboarding program where all new employees get to work hands-on in delivery, picking, replenishment, and customer service — in addition to our Data & Insight-specific onboarding. 
Get to know our way of working with OKR's — a framework we share with Google, Twitter, and Uber — and Flow, our own system for working within and between development teams to create value. 
A transparent workplace where we use Quip and Slack to communicate, discuss and share what we are working on, and stay in the loop with fewer e-mails and meetings. 
A culture that embraces and celebrates differences, built on tolerance, collaboration, and compassion. We actively seek to hire people with differences in education, personality, skillset, life experience, and knowledge base.

Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects.

Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you. 
Fluency in English.

oda,2.1,Data Scientist,Oslo,"
Build, scale, and maintain data products based on machine learning, optimization, and other types of algorithms on Google Cloud Platform. We run all of this in containers on Kubernetes under the hood, but as a data scientist, you should only need to know how to write Python code to get your stuff into production! 
Develop and deploy your own data pipelines with feature engineering, model training, and whatever else you need to get the job done. We use Argo Workflows to run all of our Python pipelines in containers, and dbt to run everything SQL on our Snowflake data warehouse. 
Work with product managers, data analysts, business representatives, and other stakeholders to understand their problems and design clever algorithmic solutions, and make sure we properly define success for improvements, establish baselines, and measure effects. 
Perform complex data analysis, communicate insights tailored to different audiences, and make recommendations based on your findings that contribute to company strategic decisions. We strive to preach and practice decision intelligence in organizational decision-making, and as a member of Data & Insight, you play a key role in these efforts. 
Contribute to our data- and insights-driven culture and community by sharing your knowledge and expertise with the team and with the company. We even have our own Data University, which is Data & Insight’s knowledge base and course catalog on everything from making correct decisions based on data to building better data products. 
Have some years of experience working as a data scientist in a business or research setting. 
Feel productive with Python and SQL, and enjoy both building things and extracting insights from data. 
Know how to apply different algorithms to solve different problems — whether it is ARIMA models for forecasting or neural networks for product recommendations — and are excited to expand your comfort zone by learning new methods and diving deeper into particular subfields. 
Have a structured approach to solving both narrowly scoped and open-ended problems, with the ability to both find optimal solutions and make appropriate cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Are able to communicate and empathize with customers and colleagues when trying to understand their problems, needs, and desires. 
Can work independently, manage your own time, and take ownership of tasks from start to finish in a dynamic environment where priorities are subject to change along the way while thriving in teams where everyone contributes their best work. 
Are eager to continuously develop, nurture and share skills through feedback and learning, together with the people around you. 
Fluency in English. 
Have a Master’s degree within a technical/engineering field or quantitative field, like computer science, physics, economics, statistics, mathematics, etc. 
Possess a strong analytical mindset, combined with creativity in the face of novel problems, and curiosity and daring when venturing into unknown territory. 
The opportunity to make a lasting mark on the daily lives of the people around you, through a product that truly contributes to their general well-being. 
A large, tight-knit Data & Insight specialist community — there are over 30 of us embedded in various teams within the company at the time of writing, and we all maintain strong ties even though we work in widely different areas! 
Excellent opportunities for personal and professional development and progression in a fast-growing, ever-changing tech company with new challenges and opportunities to solve meaningful, previously unsolved problems around every corner. We make it a priority to facilitate internal promotion and mobility so you can keep growing within the company. 
Enthusiastic colleagues who truly care about supporting and helping others. 
An onboarding program where all new employees get to work hands-on in delivery, picking, replenishment, and customer service — in addition to our Data & Insight-specific onboarding. 
Get to know our way of working with OKR's — a framework we share with Google, Twitter, and Uber — and Flow, our own system for working within and between development teams to create value. 
A transparent workplace where we use Quip and Slack to communicate, discuss and share what we are working on, and stay in the loop with fewer e-mails and meetings. 
A culture that embraces and celebrates differences, built on tolerance, collaboration, and compassion. We actively seek to hire people with differences in education, personality, skillset, life experience, and knowledge base. 
The possibility to take stock in the success of the company.",https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=301&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000017b572c3c84b04bbaff981d89e5&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_b08b2d57&cb=1629255122487&jobListingId=1007171817714&jrtk=2-0-1fdbiof5eu5fh801-1fdbiof5thip9800-fba1424ecfce6280,1.8,2.8,2.1,1.9,Full-time,NaN,other,1 to 50 Employees,NaN

You’ll also use your favorite IDE or editor; although we use different ones, we’re oddly free of those silly “mine is the best” discussions : ). You’ll work on our API gateway and ingress products on a distributed team building a feature, or reviewing open source community PRs, or improving performance, etc., in six-week development cycles, and then you’ll cool down between cycles doing self-directed learning, improving your tools, or maybe even hacking up a demo of an exciting new idea of yours. You and your team will use GitHub issues and ZenHub or Notion to track and plan the work, Markdown for documentation, CircleCI for continuous integration, Docker Hub for the resulting images, and of course Slack and Zoom.
